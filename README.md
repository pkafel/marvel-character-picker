Marvel character picker
=======================
This is a simple Ruby script that uses Wikipedia API in order to obtain Marvel universe characters and pick one of them. I use it for example for generating names for my private projects names.

To use this script just download it and run:
> ruby marvel-character-picker.rb

Example of output:
> And the winner is...
>
> Name: Sabretooth (comics)
>
> Wiki link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=310570
